# Blog
An ASP.NET 6.0 Web API for a simple blog using the Repository, Unit of Work, and CQRS patterns. I have also included Unit Tests for
the Controller methods, Command Handlers and Queries. The Web API uses SQLite as its database so the application shouldn't require any
database configuration or PM Console commands to work.
